GitBook YouTube Plugin
===

This is a plugin for inserting YouTube videos in GitBook.

## Usage

Youtube videos can be inserted into a gitbook chapter using a tag with the video id inserted inbetween:

```
{%youtube%}dQw4w9WgXcQ{%endyoutube%}
```

Please note that there should not be any space character following the video id.

## Feature

* The player will be responsive and will resize according to the page size.
* A link pointing to the video will be displayed instead if the book is converted into .pdf or other ebook formats.
